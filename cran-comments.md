### Comments

Comments from CRAN maintainer:

```
Please add hyperlinks to the websites of the diffeent projects in the
form <https://.....>.

Please single quote software names and other non English usage in Title
and Description fields, e.g. write 'EnergyPlus'.

The Title field should be in title case. Current version is:
  Create future EnergyPlus Weather files using CMIP6 data

In title case that is:
'Create Future 'EnergyPlus' Weather Files using 'CMIP6' Data

Please fix and resubmit.
```

I corrected the `Title` field in DESCRIPTION into title case,
single-quoted all abbreviations, and added all links for external
projects.
