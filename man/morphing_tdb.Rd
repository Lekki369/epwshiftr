\title{Morphing dry-bulb temperature}
\usage{
morphing_tdb(data_epw, tas, tasmax, tasmin, start_from = 2020L, cut_by = 10L)
}
\description{
Use daily mean temperature, daily maximum temperature and daily minimum
temperature to chagne only two statistical paramters of the timeseries of
temperature, namely the mean and the variance. This is achieved by shifting
by the value for mean temperature and stretching by the diurnal range.
