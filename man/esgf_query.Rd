Query CMIP6 data using ESGF search RESTful API
}
\details{
The Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) is an international collaboration for
the software that powers most global climate change research, notably
assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The ESGF search service exposes a RESTful URL that can be used by clients to
query the contents of the underlying search index, and return results
matching the given constraints. ributed capabilities of the ESGF search, the
URL at any Index Node can be used to query that Node only, or all Nodes in
the ESGF system. \code{esgf_query()} uses the \href{http://esgf-node.llnl.gov}{LLNL (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory)}
Index Node.
